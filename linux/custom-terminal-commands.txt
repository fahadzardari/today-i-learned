We can make our own custom keywords which we can use to run our required linux commands.
For doing this we make a file of .sh like
		.my-custom-commands.sh
inside the file on first line write
		
		#!/bin/bash
		
This line gives info to shell on the use of appropriate interpreter

inside the file write a function with it's name same as the custom command inside that write the commands 

	function print_anything(){
		echo "Your input: " $1
	}

$1 is any thing that is written after the use of keyword

then make executable of file using 
	
	sudo chmod +x ./.my-custom-commands.sh

then to make command available in terminal
	
	source ./.my-custom-commands.sh
	
Now just use the command in terminal 

Example: write this in terminal
	
	print_anything Fahad

output will be
	
	Your input: Fahad
